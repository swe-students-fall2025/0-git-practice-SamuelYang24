This article is interesting to me because I have taken courses in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and have come to see LLM's like ChatGPT as very advanced autocompletion programs. While I've come to understand the basis of text-based analysis fairly well, I haven't yet learned how the same technology can be used for photos and videos. 

The article does a very good job explaining latent diffusion tranformers, the latest video creation technology, in an accessible way. Specifically, I like how it dove into every part of the process, beginning by describing what a diffusion model is, then adding in the importance of latent diffusion to save energy, and finally explaining how transformer technology is used to create coherent videos. Part of why I enjoyed this article as much as I did was that it touched on the broader implications of AI development, including its energy footprint, as well as the dangers of misinformation.

Every 3 or 4 videos I come across on tiktok, theyre AI generated, so I thought this article was interesting because it really breaks down AI video generation. It also helped me understand why AI videos are suddenly everywhere. With Sora and Veo3 being easily accessible, anyone can create a high quality AI video. The articles highlight about AI's energy consunption also really stood out to me. When you consider platforms like Tiktok, instagram, and youtube, the environmental impact of these AI videos becomes a bigger issue than I expected.
